# GitGetr-Chrome-Extension / AI_Model / weights.h5
Binary file containing learned weights of the model.

The weights.h5 file typically stores the trained weights of a neural network model. It's a binary file and holds the optimized parameters learned during the model training process.

As an example, in a TensorFlow/Keras context, after training a neural network model, you would save the weights using:

```python
# Example code to save model weights
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

# Create a simple neural network
model = Sequential([
    Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(100,)),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
# ...

# Save the learned weights to weights.h5
model.save_weights('weights.h5')
